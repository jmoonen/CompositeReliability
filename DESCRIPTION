Description: The reliability of assessment tools is a crucial aspect of monitoring student performance in various educational settings. It ensures that the assessment outcomes accurately reflect a student's true level of performance. However, when assessments are combined, determining composite reliability can be challenging, especially for naturalistic and unbalanced datasets. This package provides an easy-to-use solution for calculating composite reliability for different assessment types. It allows for the inclusion of weight per assessment type and produces extensive G- and D-study results with graphical interpretations. Overall, our approach enhances the reliability of composite assessments, making it suitable for various education contexts.
